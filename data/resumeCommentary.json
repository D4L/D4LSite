    "program": "I started Software Engineering in Sept 2010. They always said that the first few terms were the hardest so after performing well in my courses, I decided to try and pick up different degrees. I had a decent amount of free time on my hands and so I thought another goal would always be challenging. Unfortunately, I really couldn't fit another major or specialty program into the Engineering Specialty program I was already so during the second term, I talked to several profs, and got into a minor in Combinatorics and Optimization, and a minor in Computational Mathematics. I chose CO because I think Combinatorics and Enumeration is just something that every programmer should have a depth of knowledge in. Besides, in our 2B term, we're supposed to take something called 'Intro to Combinatorics', so it definately seemed practical. Optimization is obviously useful, especially if I ever wanted to do a research-based job. Computational Mathematics is also very practical because it brought the general mathematics into the broader field of computer science, including finance, economics, and physics.",
