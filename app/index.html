        <div>This is a super cool website that is going to be created. I figured that since I have webspace thanks to the computer science club of waterloo and that I have unlimited time and willpower, I might as well create a website to show-off what I can do. So while I am adding Writing this in Rails, here is my resume with added commentary!
