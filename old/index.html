        <div>This is a super cool website this is going to be created. I figured that since I have webspace thanks to the computer scrience club of waterloo and that I have unlimited time and willpower, I might as well create a website to show-off what I can do. So while I am adding rails, here is my resume with added commentary!</div>
        <div>I know it isn't obvious, but this new commit got pulled in by a cron script that is run minutely to update the site to the master of it's respective git repo</div>
